## Installation
No installation is necessary for this project. Simply navigate to [here](https://whispering-reaches-66240.herokuapp.com/).


## Usage
As mentioned previously, navigate to the [site](https://whispering-reaches-66240.herokuapp.com/) to begin. Once there, a list of posts will be displayed on the homepage. Without an account, you may only view these posts and their respective comments. If you'd like to post and comment as well, you will need to navigate to the signup page. You can do this by clicking on the 'Login' link in the navigation bar. Once you create a username and password, you'll be free to comment on any other user's post as well as manage your own set of posts via the dashboard link. 


## How to Contribute
Future contributions to this project will entail adding partials to the handelbars files, adding a more robust stylesheet (currently Bootstrap is being used solely), and expanding upon the user, i.e. adding profile pictures, bios, etc.
